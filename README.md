# Pathfinding Starter Code
Requirements:
- The Random player shall have a randomly assigned path which begins with the start node, ends with the exit node, and hits the target along the path. The path shall be a valid traversal such that each sequential pair of nodes in the path are connected by an edge.
- Add another statistic to the scoreboard (up to interpretation)

(explain your random pathing algorithm and the statistic you added to the scoreboard)
